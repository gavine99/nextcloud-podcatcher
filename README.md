# nextcloud-podcatcher

A simple podcatcher app for own/nextCloud.

If you'd like to take over maintenance of this app please create an issue ticket.

This app works nicely with own/nextcloud music app - https://github.com/owncloud/music - which provides the ability to play music/podcasts via a web ui, and subsonic and ampache apps. It can be configured to download podcasts directly into the music app directory which are then picked up by that app and become playable via it.
